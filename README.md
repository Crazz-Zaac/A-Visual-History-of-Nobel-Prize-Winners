# A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners
In this part of my practising journey, I visualized the Nobel Prize Winners dataset
containing the data from 1901 to 2016. Using data science tools, I successfully
visualized the most dominating country for wining the Nobel prizes.
The following information was inferred from the dataset:
1. Out of 911 Nobel prize winners, 836 are males and only 49 are females  
2. United States of America is the most dominating country with a total of
259 Nobel prizes followed by United Kingdom (85 Nobel prizes) and Germany
(61 Nobel prizes). More than 40% of the winners are born in USA and has kept the
leading position ever since.
